# Landslide-Tsurrogate-V1.0

## User Manual

This is for the moment the only content of the project.

The  User Manual is a Jupyter Notebook that describes, and illustrate for the Mayotte test case, the different steps and functions needed to build 
surrogate models based on gPCE for summarine landslide tsunamis.

The User Manual consists in:

- the jupyter notebook (JN): User_Manual.ipynb
- 4 different sub-folders: <br>
    * data: all the data used to build the surrogate models for the Mayotte test case <br>
    * figures: all the figures used in the JN <br>
    * simulations: all the results from the deterministic simulations <br>
    * results: an empty folder where the results from the JN are copied <br>
