    "## INTRODUCTION\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last decade, **surrogate model approaches**—providing fast-running approximations of complex dynamical models—have been gaining traction in the geoscience community (e.g., Formaggia et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016; Sraj et al., 2014; Giraldi et al., 2017). Compared to sampling approaches (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations), surrogate models are **highly efficient for uncertainty quantification** and, once trained for a given location, can be used **without additional computational resources** (Knio and Le Maître, 2006; Najm et al., 2009). Moreover, as surrogate models are driven by information needs and their **training is relatively inexpensive**, they require **limited computational and observational resources**. For example, surrogate models can be built with limited knowledge of the uncertain parameter prior distributions (e.g., **uniform distributions** can be used when observations are scarce), and a **scarse sampling** of these distributions (e.g., **sparse grids**)—compared to Monte Carlo simulations—can be used to minimize the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, **surrogate models** can be seen as a **natural solution for Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment (PTHA)** in regions of the world where observational data and modeling capacities are lacking. In this context, surrogate models propagate the uncertainties associated with tsunami sources (seismic, volcanic, landslide, or atmospheric) to assess the probability of scenario distributions exceeding defined tsunami hazard metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following **Jupyter Notebook** serves as the **User Manual** for the **Landslide-Tsurrogate Model V1.0 (REFERENCE_ARTICLE)** and documents the various steps (along with code) used to build surrogate models for **tsunamis generated by landslides**. The surrogate model construction is illustrated using the **Mayotte** (France, Fig. 1) test case. For more details about the mathematical framework, the Mayotte test case, and the literature related to landslide-tsunamis, please refer to **REFERENCE_ARTICLE**. Throughout the document, the symbol ***<font color='green'>@user</font>*** indicates that the user should perform an action.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Mayotte** is a **volcanic area** located in the Indian Ocean, composed of the **islands of Petite Terre and Grande Terre** that are surrounded by a well-developed shallow submarine shelf forming a lagoon (Fig. 1). Following the intense **seismo-volcanic crisis in 2018** (Mercury et al., 2022), preliminary assessments have identified **Mayotte** as an area where **submarine landslides** could generate **catastrophic tsunami waves** (Feuillet et al., 2021; Roger, 2019; Poulain et al., 2022; Marboeuf et al., 2025). In particular, **landslides** occurring in the **Piton area** (Fig. 1) have the potential to pose a **serious threat** to the **local population and infrastructure** (Poulain et al., 2022; Lemoine et al., 2020b), as they could generate submarine landslide **tsunamis** characterized by (i) **rapid arrival time**, (ii) relatively **large wave amplitudes**, and (iii) **lack of forewarning** (Roger et al., 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of the **Landslide-Tsurrogate Model V1.0 (REFERENCE_ARTICLE)** in **Mayotte** is thus designed to provide a **faster-than-real-time forecast** of tsunami waves in the event of a **detected landslide** in the **Piton area**. As no landslide-tsunami events have yet been observed in this region, the surrogate model is **entirely based on deterministic numerical model results**. However, because landslide-tsunami models are computationally demanding, a **computationally inexpensive stochastic surrogate model strategy**—based on the **generalized Polynomial Chaos Expansion** (**gPCE**; Xiu and Karniadakis, 2002a,b, 2003; Soize and Ghanem, 2004)—is employed to forecast tsunamis generated by landslides. The main advantage of this approach is that it enables efficient **uncertainty propagation**, as moments and sensitivity indices can be directly extracted from the coefficients of the **gPCE decomposition**. The validity of using a surrogate model in this context is based on the assumption (Ernst et al., 2012) that a **full gPCE** for maximum elevation, maximum speed, and time of arrival of tsunami waves **converges** (i.e., the **mean-square error** between gPCE results and deterministic simulations tends to zero as the expansion becomes infinite). This assumption has **already been validated** for tsunami hazards generated by **atmospheric sources in the Adriatic Sea** (Denamiel et al., 2019, 2020, 2021).\n",

    "### 2) SAMPLING FUNCTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding to STEP 1, it is important for the user to become familiar with the routines used to sample the uniform distributions. For the Mayotte use case, the **Gauss–Patterson delayed sparse nested grid rules** (Patterson, 1968; Holtz, 2011) are employed. These rules maintain **high precision in the computation of deterministic coefficients** while significantly **reducing the number of stochastic variable values** required for quadrature, compared to traditional rules. As a result, they **optimize the number of deterministic simulations** and thereby **lower the numerical cost** of building the surrogate models.\n",

    "*******************************************\n",

    "**Quadrature rules** are used to find the **best approximation** to **integrate** quantities. The **Gauss–Patterson quadrature** is a nested family that begins with the **Gauss–Legendre rules of orders 1 and 3**, and then successively inserts**one new abscissa into each subinterval**. Consequently, beyond the second rule, the Gauss–Patterson rules **do not retain the ultra-high precision of the original Gauss–Legendre rules**. Instead, they trade this precision for the **advantage of nestedness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practically**, this means that **all deterministic simulations** required at a given **order n** are **also used at order n+1**. As a result, **surrogate models** can be progressively **upgraded over time**, which is especially beneficial if the user lacks the numerical resources to run all high-order simulations at once.\n",
